// M3 — read-only lookup the SignalR hub uses to authenticate a connecting runner. The connect handshake
// carries no tenant context (the token IS the credential), so this lookup is deliberately tenant-
// unfiltered: it finds the runner row by its unguessable id, and the caller then verifies the presented
// token against the returned hash before trusting TenantId / OwnerUserId for routing.
